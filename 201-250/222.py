# Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.
#
# Note:
#
# Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
# In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
#
# Example:
#
# Input:
#     1
#    / \
#   2   3
#  / \  /
# 4  5 6
#
# Output: 6
